# Creating-API-s-using-Django
Implementation Details
Django REST Framework Setup: The project was initiated with the setup of the Django REST framework, providing a robust and scalable foundation for API development.

Resource Creation: Two main resources were defined and created. Each resource was carefully designed to encapsulate relevant data and functionalities.

API Development:

APIs for each resource were developed to allow for standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
These APIs were designed following RESTful principles to ensure they are stateless, scalable, and easy to use.
